### Map Search

Use the **Map Search** operation to find places on Google Maps by location and query.

- You can enter either a location name (e.g., "New York") or geographic coordinates (e.g., "40.7128,-74.0060").
- Add your search query (e.g., "coffee shop").
- Specify the page number you want to retrieve results from.

See the example below:

![Map Search operation in n8n](images/operations/mapSearch1.png)

#### Example Output

Once you have run the operation, you will get an output like this:

![Map Search output example](images/operations/mapSearch2.png)

If no data is found, you will see a message like this:

![No data found output example](images/operations/mapSearch3.png)

### Review

Use the **Review** operation to gather reviews from Google Maps for a specific place.

- First, obtain the Place Data ID from a previous Map Search operation.
- Enter the Place Data ID into the Review operation to fetch reviews for that location.

See the example below:

![Review operation in n8n](images/operations/MapReview1.png)

#### Fetching Additional Pages

If there are more reviews available, the response will include a `next_page_token`. Use this token in the Review operation to fetch the next page of reviews.

See the example below:
